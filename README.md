# Gurka Bot

![The bot's profile pic](./bot-profile-pic.png)

## What is this?

This is a stupid bot that I made for a server I'm on so we can listen to music. It's written in Typescript and has a bunch of _VERY FUNNY_ inside jokes built-in.

## Does it only play music?

Basically, yes.

## Should I use this bot?

**No.**

You need to go through a bunch of extra fuss to host it yourself and it's not that feature rich either, so it isn't a good bot for you.

You'd be better of making a bot yourself. It'll be a good learning experience for you and you'll be able to customize it to suit your own server's inside jokes. Just go and read up on [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). If you really want, you can read the code for this bot to get an idea how yours should work, although I'm not sure how much that would help.

If you don't want to learn programming this way or don't want to bother, look up **"self hosted music bot"**. They don't seem to be under risk of being taken down. You'll find much better bots out there.

## "Gurka"?

Cucumber in German (_die Gurke_), but purposefully butchered.

## What are the moon runes in the messages the bot sends?
